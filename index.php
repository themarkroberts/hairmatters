      <p>Introducing Karina, our newest member of the HM FAM. Karina has recently moved to the coast from the Ukraine.</p>
      <p>She originally studied at Kyiv National University of Technologies and Design where she discovered her passion for fashion. For more then 10yrs she dedicated herself to the fashion industry, starting her own clothing brand, worked on photoshoots, fashion shows and movies! Not only as a fashion designer but as a stylist.</p>
      <p>Once graduating as a colorist and stylist, Karina could now compete her dream of recreating a person's image from the outside in. She adores making people feel beautiful. Now not only does she mix colours on paper, she creates walkimg works of art.</p>
      <p>Karina believes that her biggest drawback is that she is a perfectionist, more often then not she will hold u hostage until she is completely satisfied with your new look.</p>
